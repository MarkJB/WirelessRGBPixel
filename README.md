Early testing code/electronics for proof of concept.

Wireless RGB Pixel is just that, a wireless (NRF24L01+) RGB led (WS2812b) controlled by an Atmel ATTiny85. One or more 'pixels' can be controlled by an Arduino with another NRF24L01+ module.

It is hoped that many of these 'pixels' can be manufactured and installed somewhere and controlled to create an interesting light show.

As of Dec 2016 PCB is at v1.2.

This version uses the original circuit design. No pin mux or serial debug is available.
